**Project Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions to ensure that customers are not wrongfully charged for items they did not purchase.

**Main Challenges**

Enormous Data Volume

Challenge: Processing vast amounts of transaction data daily.
Solution: The model must be optimized for speed to promptly identify and respond to fraudulent activities.

Imbalanced Data

Challenge: The majority of transactions (99.8%) are legitimate, making it difficult to detect the fraudulent ones.
Solution: Implement techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE.

Data Availability

Challenge: Access to transaction data is often restricted due to privacy concerns.
Solution: Utilize anonymized datasets and focus on feature engineering to reduce data dimensionality while preserving user privacy.

Misclassified Data

Challenge: Not all fraudulent transactions are detected and reported, leading to potential misclassification.
Solution: Use reliable data sources that verify the accuracy of the transactions, especially during the training phase of the model.

Adaptive Techniques by Scammers

Challenge: Scammers continuously evolve their techniques to bypass detection models.
Solution: Develop a simple and interpretable model that can be quickly adjusted and redeployed to counteract new fraud tactics.

**Solutions and Strategies**

Fast and Efficient Models

Develop models that are simple yet powerful enough to detect anomalies in real-time, ensuring quick classification of fraudulent transactions.

Handling Imbalanced Data

**Use methods such as:**

Oversampling: Increase the number of fraudulent transaction samples.
Undersampling: Reduce the number of non-fraudulent transaction samples.
Synthetic Data Generation: Apply techniques like SMOTE to generate synthetic samples of fraudulent transactions.

**Data Privacy**

Protect user privacy by reducing data dimensionality through feature selection and extraction techniques.
Reliable Data Sources

Ensure data accuracy by sourcing from trustworthy providers who double-check transaction data, especially for training the model.
Adaptive and Interpretable Models

Design models that are easy to interpret and modify, allowing for quick updates to counteract evolving scam tactics.
